 Complete Beginner's Guide: Object Detection Setup

 What You're Building
A real-time object detection system that can detect people, cars, chairs, and 80+ different objects using your webcam.

 What You've Already Done
Created a Python virtual environment  
Installed OpenCV and NumPy  
Have Python 3.8 ready to use  

 Quick Start - Simple Steps

 Step 1: Open Terminal in VS Code
- Make sure you see `(my_surveillance_env)` at the start of your command line
- If not, type: `my_surveillance_env\Scripts\activate`

 Step 2: Download the Model Files
Run this command to download everything needed:

python download_files.py


 Step 3: Test Everything Works
Run this command:

python test_setup.py

 Step 4: Start Object Detection
Run this command:

python simple_detection.py


 What You'll See
- A window with your webcam feed
- Green boxes around detected objects (people, chairs, etc.)
- Labels showing what was detected
- Confidence percentages (like "person: 0.85" means 85% sure)
- Press 'q' to quit the program

 If Something Doesn't Work

 Webcam Issues:
- Close other apps using camera
- Make sure camera privacy settings allow VS Code

 File Issues:
- Check you have "models" folder with 3 files inside
- Run the download script again if files are missing

 Environment Issues:
- Always see `(my_surveillance_env)` in terminal
- If not there, run: `my_surveillance_env\Scripts\activate`

 What You Need in Your Folder

object_tracking
 models/ (folder with 3 files)
 download_files.py
 test_setup.py
 simple_detection.py


 When It Works Successfully
- Objects get green boxes around them
- You see labels like "person", "chair", "cell phone"
- Program runs smoothly
- You can press 'q' to exit

 Important Notes
- No TensorFlow needed - it works with OpenCV only
- Uses your computer's CPU (no special hardware needed)
- Works with any standard webcam
- Detects 80+ common objects


Just follow the 4 steps above and you'll have object detection running! The code files you need are already prepared.
